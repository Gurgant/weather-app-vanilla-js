### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

#### Starting the Backend Server

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend server will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Since the frontend consists of static files, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve it using a static server.

- **Option 1**: Open Directly
  Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

- **Option 2**: Use a Static Server

  Install a simple static server globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g serve
  ```

  Serve the frontend:

  ```bash
  serve
  ```

  The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or another port if specified).
